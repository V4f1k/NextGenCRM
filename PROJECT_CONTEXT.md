- **Base Models**: Reusable abstractions for UUID, timestamps, soft delete
- **Custom User Model**: Extended authentication with CRM fields
- **JSON Fields**: Flexible data storage for roles, tags, settings
- **Generic Relationships**: Task and Call models can link to any entity

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for API and UI
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React state for UI
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form for performance, Zod for validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Consistent**: Uniform response format and error handling
- **Filterable**: Advanced querying capabilities
- **Paginated**: Efficient large dataset handling
- **Documented**: Auto-generated API documentation
